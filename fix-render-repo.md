# Fix Render Repository Configuration

## Problem Identified
Render is deploying from the wrong repository:
- **Render is using**: `https://github.com/ParthZanwar01/Space-Apps-Backend`
- **Should be using**: `https://github.com/ParthZanwar01/Space-Apps`

## Solution

### Option 1: Update Render Service Settings
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Find your backend service
3. Go to "Settings" → "Build & Deploy"
4. Change "Repository" to: `https://github.com/ParthZanwar01/Space-Apps`
5. Ensure "Root Directory" is set to: `backend`
6. Save and trigger a new deployment

### Option 2: Create New Service (Recommended)
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Connect GitHub repository: `https://github.com/ParthZanwar01/Space-Apps`
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: `space-apps-backend`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python app.py`
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
5. Add Environment Variables:
   - `FLASK_ENV` = `production`
   - `PORT` = `10000`

### Option 3: Sync Repositories
If you want to keep using `Space-Apps-Backend`:
1. Copy the updated code from `Space-Apps` to `Space-Apps-Backend`
2. Push changes to `Space-Apps-Backend`
3. Trigger deployment on Render

## Expected Result
After fixing the repository:
- Backend will have the latest code with HTTPS URLs
- Image overlays will work in production
- Path visualization will show dots on images
- No more localhost URLs

## Current Status
- ✅ Code is correct in `Space-Apps` repository
- ✅ Render deployment is working
- ❌ Wrong repository is being deployed
- ❌ Old code is running on Render
